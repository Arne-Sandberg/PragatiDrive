# PragatiDrive
PragatiDrive is a multitenant SAAS application developed using Python Django framework to store data on a cloud in distributed fashion.
The portal compresses and breaks the file in smaller files. Each of the file is uploaded to different cloud and a database for the same is maintained. When a file is required, the smaller chunks of the file gets downloaded and then merged.
Each of the tenants were able to change the behavior (User rights, file permissions etc) and environment (look and feel) of the system depending on their requirement.
